csv_lookup.py by james270tx

A demo of my process for using python to lookup records in one csv to another
This can be usefull for looking up deatils of customer records en mass from a text file or csv

csv_lookup.py matches details from the reference file customers-1000.csv to the query file demo-input.csv

demo_generator.py creates demo-input.csv: a random csv of 100 customer ids to query against the customers-1000.csv master list.

demo-input.csv is the list of customer ids we intend to look up to the details of
customers-1000.csv is the reference file containing all details
summary.csv is the results
